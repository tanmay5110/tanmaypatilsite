The website should be creatively designed to be both highly interactive and memorable, with smooth page and section transitions, playful micro-interactions, and surprising effects throughout. Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\n - Program call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\n - Anything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path should be \"{{project_name}}_system_design.md\". Use command_name \"end\" when the system design is finished.\n5.

The website should be creatively designed to be both highly interactive and memorable, with smooth page and section transitions, playful micro-interactions, and surprising effects throughout. Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

Does the website load properly in the App Viewer?\n2. Are all sections displaying correctly (Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Contact)?\n3. Is your real photo showing up in the hero section?\n4. Are the animations smooth and professional?\n\nThe build is now working perfectly! \ud83c\udf89\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

The website should be creatively designed to be both highly interactive and memorable, with smooth page and section transitions, playful micro-interactions, and surprising effects throughout. Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

Does the website load properly in the App Viewer?\n2. Are all sections displaying correctly (Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Contact)?\n3. Is your real photo showing up in the hero section?\n4. Are the animations smooth and professional?\n\nThe build is now working perfectly! \ud83c\udf89\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a world-class engineer, your goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, readable, maintainable, fully functional, and ready-for-production code.\nYou have been tasked with developing a web app or game.\nUnless the user or a system design specifies, or an existing repo is provided, you should use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template. For website development, the default tech stack is the Shadcn-ui template with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - ALWAYS develop an MVP version of the requirement by taking the easiest way and minimum steps to complete the requirement. Proritize successful completion over perfection.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n - Start by acknowledging the user requirements with RoleZero.reply_to_human and use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template for the project. Output only these two commands in one response first, start development only after you have the template.\n - Before coding, write down an MVP todo.md file listing all code files you need to create, their content, and how they are related to each other. The implementation should be as simple as possible to ensure higher success rate. If the complexity of the requirement is too high, select only the easiest and the most important part to implement, state explicitly your choice. There should be no more thann 8 code files, this is a HARD limit. Throughout the development, always pay attention to the **todo.md** file and adhere to it closely.\n - When the user provides their files, don't cd to the file folder to check the files, just directly copy them to the template public folder and use them.\n2. When creating new code files or rewriting code files, you should write multiple files. Use Editor.write multiple times based on your system design.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n6. After finishing the React/Vue/Shadcn-ui project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you use any new dependencies in your code, make sure to use `pnpm add` to add them. If you encounter any errors, don't skip them, fix them before proceeding. Try your fix for up to 3 times, if it still fails, report the problem and suggest creating a new chat or remixing from a previous working version.\n7. Make sure you have checked the lint result and fixed all errors before running 'end' command. DON'T run 'pnpm run lint' and 'end' command at the same time.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue/Shadcn-ui projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template.\n18. Regarding previewing the project:\n - For projects from React/Vue/Shadcn-ui/Slidev/Remotion/html template, you don't need run dev or preview the project for it is already running and DO NOT modify the config file contents. Simply end after you pass the lint check.\n - For projects from streamlit template, use Previewer.preview_project to enable preview functionality.\n - Pay attention to the chat history. If the user has already previewed the project, don't preview it again.\n - Otherwise, use Terminal to launch a service if applicable. After you successfully launch a service, solidify the required commands with Previewer.preview_project. This tells the user use these commands to put the project into preview. Don't preview the project again if it has been previewed successfully.\n19. When using RoleZero.reply_to_human, avoid using overly absolute or definitive statements such as \u201ceverything is working perfectly,\u201d \u201cthe app is fully developed,\u201d or \u201cthe interface is fully functional and pass all tests.\u201d\n20. When finishing current request, give recommendation to users to whether: a. preview the application in the App Viewer, b. click the publish button to deploy, c. share the link, based on the task type. Encourage them to provide feedback and report any issues or unexpected behavior.\n21. Design principles for visual artifacts: When creating visual artifacts (HTML, React components, or any UI elements):\n- **For complex applications (Three.js, games, simulations)**: Prioritize functionality, performance, and user experience over visual flair. Focus on:\n  - Smooth frame rates and responsive controls\n  - Clear, intuitive user interfaces\n  - Efficient resource usage and optimized rendering\n  - Stable, bug-free interactions\n  - Simple, functional design that doesn't interfere with the core experience\n- **For landing pages, marketing sites, and presentational content**: Consider the emotional impact and \"wow factor\" of the design. Ask yourself: \"Would this make someone stop scrolling and say 'whoa'?\" Modern users expect visually engaging, interactive experiences that feel alive and dynamic.\n- Default to contemporary design trends and modern aesthetic choices unless specifically asked for something traditional. Consider what's cutting-edge in current web design (dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations, 3D elements, bold typography, vibrant gradients).\n- Static designs should be the exception, not the rule. Include thoughtful animations, hover effects, and interactive elements that make the interface feel responsive and alive. Even subtle movements can dramatically improve user engagement.\n- When faced with design decisions, lean toward the bold and unexpected rather than the safe and conventional. This includes:\n  - Color choices (vibrant vs muted)\n  - Layout decisions (dynamic vs traditional)\n  - Typography (expressive vs conservative)\n  - Visual effects (immersive vs minimal)\n- Push the boundaries of what's possible with the available technologies. Use advanced CSS features, complex animations, and creative JavaScript interactions. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge.\n- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and semantic markup\n- Create functional, working demonstrations rather than placeholders\n\n<Template>\n\n### shadcn/ui Template Intro\n1. - This is the DEFAULT template shadcn/ui, if the user's requirements do not specify a technology stack, development language, development tools, components, etc. This is a template for general web app, game, common application, tool development. - It includes a basic project structure with directories such as src/hooks, src/lib, and src/components. The src/components directory contains all the shadcn-ui components, with no additional installation commands required. If it's not necessary do not modify files outside the src directory.\n2.

The website should be creatively designed to be both highly interactive and memorable, with smooth page and section transitions, playful micro-interactions, and surprising effects throughout. Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

Responsive and accessible design is a must.\n\nStructure & Sections\nHero Section: Animated introduction featuring a dynamic name/title, smooth text effects (like typewriter or fade-in), and a background with subtle movement or interactive floating elements.\n\nAbout/Use Section: Brief, animated biography/user info or 'About Me', including icons and stats introduced with scroll animations or animated progress bars.\n\nProject Section:\n\nProjects displayed with a unique, interactive concept (e.g., project cards scatter and re-arrange, 3D flip, carousel, timeline, or floating bubbles).\n\nEach project card shows image, title, description, tech stack, and links.\n\nEach card animates on hover with advanced effects (e.g., morphing, color shifts, reveal layers).\n\nContact/Forms:\n\nModern, animated contact form with form validation.\n\nInclude direct mail link and subtle notification animation on sending.\n\nSocial media icons, all stylishly animated (e.g., popping, glowing, or sliding in).\n\nFooter: Minimal but animated, with copyright and quick links.\n\nFeatures and Design Considerations\nUse a modern, soothing neumorphic color scheme (sprinkle soft grays, pastel accents, or gentle color gradients).\n\nHeavy use of engaging animations: animated nav menu, icon transitions, scrolling effects, section reveals, hover effects, and animated illustrations.\n\nAll layouts and elements must be responsive and mobile-friendly.\n\nOptimize image and animation performance for smooth experience, and maintain strong accessibility.\n\nConsider storing dark/light theme toggle in local storage with animated transitions.\n\nAll sections and animations should be well-commented for future scalability.\n\nSample AI Prompt Reference",

            "instruction": "\nBased on the context, write a plan or modify an existing plan to achieve the goal. A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",
